# css + js clock

Clock that takes in current time and updates the hands (second, minute, hour)

rotate the hands depending on what time it is

```css
transform: rotate(20deg);
```

rotate on the very right hand side (in the middle)

## TODO

- better function to not have to recreate all the types(second,min,hour) since it's the same for each with a few exceptions
- add numbers
